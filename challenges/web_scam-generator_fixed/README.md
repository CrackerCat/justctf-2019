### Scam Generator Fixed

Recently, I was scammed by a guy who introduced himself as *Abraham Morrison,Esq*.
He offered me *$10.250.000.00* as gratification in helping them champion their business.
I called the police the very same minute I realized it was a scam and I lost all of my saving money 
and they told me that without their real identity they cannot do much.
They asked me to bring scammer's phone number and they will try to locate where the scammer 
is located. I also then realized that the phone in the e-mail *0-700-880-774* was fake.

I found a website that scammers use to generate personalized scam messages 
[scam-generator.web.jctf.pro](http://scam-generator.web.jctf.pro). 
I spent hours and hours trying on exploiting but was unsuccessful. 

I also found, that you can report bugs on [report-scam-generator.web.jctf.pro](http://scam-generator-report.web.jctf.pro). It might be handy.

I contacted the police and provided them with your findings but they say it was fake news. 

CAN YOU HELP ME ONCE MORE AND **FIND** THE REAL **IDENTITY** OF THE SCAMMER?
