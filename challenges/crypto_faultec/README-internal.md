### fault ec

Service for elliptic curve point multiplication with bit-flips at random moments in temporary point Q's x value. The task was to implement differential fault attack described in the paper "Differential Fault Attacks on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems" by Ingrid Biehl, Bernd Meyer, Volker MÃ¼ller. That allowed us to compute private key and decrypt the flag.
