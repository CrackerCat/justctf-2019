# Discreet

The idea is that the flag, treated as a complex signal, is converted via the discrete Fourier transform and the resulting vector is made public.
The html files in subdirectories are a modified version of my [old toy project](https://altairq.github.io/dft2d/) which additionally visualises the inverse Fourier transform in time.
